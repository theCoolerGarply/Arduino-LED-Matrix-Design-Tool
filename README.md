4. Copy the text in this cell ![Pattern Cell]() and paste it into the PATTERN constant in the script file ![Pattern Constant]().
5. Make sure that the LED_PIN constant is set to the data pin number you are using in your setup.
6. When you run the script after these steps the image you designed should show up on your LED Matrix.
